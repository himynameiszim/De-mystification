            "co-text": "Hollande’s side, made clear her fundamental and unchanged position: no money for Greece unless it agrees to far more structural reform than Mr. Tsipras has heretofore countenanced. Furthermore, Ms. Merkel seems to speak for most, if not all, of the other member countries of Europe’s common currency, who do not relish throwing more good money after bad in Greece, notwithstanding the harsh impact of austerity thus far.. . In a sensible world, Greece never would have been admitted to the euro zone on the basis of economic data that everyone knew or should have known were cooked.",
            "context": "The text highlights a firm stance from France (represented by Hollande) and Germany (Merkel) regarding financial assistance to Greece. **The core message is that Greece will not receive further funding unless it accepts significantly deeper structural reforms than previously agreed upon.** This position is broadly supported by other Eurozone countries who are wary of continuing to financially support Greece given the already damaging effects of austerity measures and the questionable economic data used to initially admit Greece into the Eurozone.",
