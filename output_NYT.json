Mainstream governments like Mr. Letta’s must convince voters that they can do more than administer the austerity demanded by Germany and can deliver the economic relief demanded by their citizens.. . Mr. Letta, in office since April, has, until now, been constrained by his need to avoid offending former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who controlled enough votes to bring down the government.",
            "context": "The text highlights the challenge facing Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta. While warnings alone are insufficient to reverse current trends, Letta needs to persuade Italian voters that his government can provide economic relief beyond the austerity measures dictated by Germany. This has been difficult thus far because he's had to navigate the political influence of Silvio Berlusconi, whose support was crucial for maintaining the government's stability. **The final sentence underscores that Letta's ability to enact meaningful change has been hampered by his need to appease Berlusconi, demonstrating a significant constraint on his political agency.**",

Germany, the biggest economy in the euro zone, has long been a major contributor to imbalances in the global economy. It exports far more than it imports and does too little to encourage the growth of domestic demand.
